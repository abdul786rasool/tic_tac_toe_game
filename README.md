I have developed an algorithm in C++ that allows players to engage in a competitive game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent. 

Title: Tic Tac Toe Game (Player vs Computer) in C++
____________________________________________________

Description: This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a turn-based manner. The player marks cells on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the computer does.

Features:
__________
1.Player vs Computer gameplay: Engage in a challenging battle against the computer opponent, which utilizes a set of possibilities to make intelligent moves.
Interactive Command-Line Interface: The game provides a user-friendly command-line interface for inputting moves and displaying the current state of the board.

2.Error Handling: The program handles invalid moves and displays appropriate error messages to ensure a smooth user experience.

3.Win Detection: The game accurately detects and announces the winner (player or computer) or declares a draw when no more moves are possible.

4.Engaging Competition: While the computer doesn't employ advanced AI techniques, it provides a competitive experience by considering various possibilities during its turn, leading to challenging gameplay.

This implementation serves as a beginner-friendly example for understanding basic game logic and creating interactive console-based applications using C++. Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game's features or extend it with additional functionalities.

Please note that this implementation does not involve advanced AI techniques but focuses on delivering a compelling competition for players.
